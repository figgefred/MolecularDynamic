% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/
\usepackage{float}

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for

%

\author{Frederick Ceder,~\IEEEmembership{IS2200 Lab 2,} % <-this % stops a space
}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} journal will explains several solutions to tasks at hand that all have the goal to parallelize a Molecular Dynamics Program. The program is part of the lab assignment of the course IS2200 Parallel Systems, given by Mats Brorson.

\section{Analysis tools}
\label{sec:analysis}
Vtune amplifier will be used in order to collect data in order to find performance issues such as performance bottlenecks or data races.
\subsection{inspxe-cl}
\label{sec:inspxe}
inspxe-cl is a tool that can be used to find data-races. Code \ref{code:inspxe} list some commands used for the measurements.

\begin{code}[here]
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
# Take a measuremenht
inspxe-cl -collect ti2 <exec>
  
# Report example
inspxe-cl -report problems
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Data collection and report command of inspxe-cl, VTune Amplifier}
  \label{code:inspxe}
\end{code}

If it detects a data race, then one could either run the inspxe-cl instance again with the ti3 option as it will point out the data race problem or simply try to find the problem manually, as the parallelization changes are probably known.

\subsection{amplxe-cl}
\label{sec:amplxe}
If inspxe-cl succeeds and the results created by the program are as expected, then amplxe-cl can be used to find performance bottlenecks by measuring CPU time. Code \ref{code:amplxe} list the bash commands used to do measurements and compile the results.

\begin{code}[here]
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
# Take a measuremenht
amplxe-cl -collect hotspots <exec>
  
# Report example
amplxe-cl -report hotspots -group-by=thread
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Data collection and report command of amplxe-cl, VTune Amplifier}
  \label{code:amplxe}
\end{code}

If the results show that each thread have large deviating execution times, then this is an indication of load imbalance. If one thread has most of the execution time and the others a lot less, then it might be an indication of poor parallelization. By using the the \textbf{\emph{concurrency}} option instead of hotspots (for the -collect action), one would receive more values such as thread wait-time, which gives an indication of the synchronization cost due to the parallelization.

\section{Sequential execution}
\label{sec:sequential}
Figure \ref{sec:result01} are the results of a measurement made using the VTune amplifier, amplxe-cl.

\begin{figure}[here]
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
Function  Module  CPU:Self Overhead  Spin
--------  ------  -------  --------  --------
forces    md       24.050         0         0
mkekin    md        0.010         0         0
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Analysis of MolDyn program executed sequentially.}
  \label{fig:result01}
\end{figure}

The results in figure \ref{code:result01} illustrate different times (\textbf{in seconds}) that a module was in a specific method call, either for executing the method (CPU:Self), creating threads (overhead) or spinning due to a sychronization mechanism, such as a lock. The latter two are for a purely serial execution of course 0 and thus it becomes clear that the forces method has the most execution time and is most likely the method of interest when it comes to parallelization.

\section{Task 1}
Task 1 is to parallelize the forces function, mentioned in \ref{sec:sequential}. According to the task specification OpenMP constructs and atomics are going to be used to parallelize the sequential code. Code \ref{code:impl11} shows a snippet with relevant parallelization parts from the forces.c code.

\begin{code}[here]
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=c++]
  function forces(...)
    ...
    #pragma omp parallel for 
    	default(none) 
        schedule(dynamic)
        shared(...) 
        private(i, j) 
        reduce(+:epot, vir)

    for (i=0; i<npart*3; i+=3) {

	  ...
      
      for (j=i+3; j<npart*3; j+=3) {

        ...

        if (rd<=rcoff*rcoff) {
		...
          
        #pragma omp atomic
          f[j]    -= xx*r148;
        #pragma omp atomic
          f[j+1]  -= yy*r148;
        #pragma omp atomic
          f[j+2]  -= zz*r148;

        }
      }
	#pragma omp atomic
	f[i]     += fxi;
  	#pragma omp atomic
	f[i+1]   += fyi;
  	#pragma omp atomic
	f[i+2]   += fzi;

    }
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Task 1: parallel implementation}
  \label{code:impl11}
\end{code}

Code \ref{code:impl11} illustrates a solution to task 1. A dynamic schedule is used as a static schedule would otherwise cause load imbalance between the worker threads, as the work is dependent on the value interval of j that decreases with an increasing size of i. The variables of \textbf{i} and \textbf{j} are private. \textbf{epo} and \textbf{vir} global values, yet they are the results of simple summations in every iteration of the inner for loop and thus these can be calculated individually by each thread using the \textbf{reduction construct}. For the rest of the global variables there are only reads, except for the \textbf{f} array that is kept in synchronization using the atomic constructs. By placing any of the private variables as a globally shared variable, which without the default(none) statemenet they  would be, one would have noticed by running the inspxle tool that there is a datarace problem.

Figure \ref{fig:result11} contains a table with results from an execution on 8 threads with a static schedule plan. It is clear that all threads do not do the same amount of work, just compare column CPU:Time of thread 1 and 7 with each other. In figure \ref{fig:result12} on the other hand one can cleary see that dynamic scheduling improves the workload balancing. The CPU:Time values are identical.

\section{Task 2}
The next task is to create a parallel region in the main function. One knows that the forces method is called in a for-loop executed in the main function, thus the overhead of creating a new parallel region in the forces function as implemented in task 1, the creation can be reduced to only once if implemented in the main method. The objective of task 2 is thus to investigate how work-sharing between threads changes, compared to task 1, when the parallel region is created in the main method.

A task-based implementation was implemented. The main idea is that a single thread will function as a coordinator or task creator and create tasks for a pool of workers. The parallel region in the main method only contains a single directive, where the for-loop is placed, which iterates over the moves (implying calls to force). The different work done by the workers is essentially the same as in task 1 (inner for-loop of the for-loop in forces function) only that there will be more overhead as a single thread will explicitly declare those sections as tasks, available for any worker claiming it. Code \ref{code:impl21} contains the relevant changes of forces.c. Note the explicit declaration of local variables for each individual task of vir and epot, in order to avoid some atomic operations. After the function call on forces there will be an explicit \textbf{taskwait} directive, which will make sure that all the workers finish the tasks from forces so that the single thread may continue.

\begin{code}[here]
	\begin{lstlisting}[style=c++]
    	
function forces(int npart, double x[], 
	double f[], double side, double rcoff){

    int   i, j;
    vir    = 0.0;
    epot   = 0.0;

    for (i=0; i<npart*3; i+=3) {
    #pragma omp task firstprivate(i) private(j) 
      	{
          ...
          double my_vir = 0.0, my_epot = 0.0;
       
          for (j=i+3; j<npart*3; j+=3) {
      
              ...	
      
              if (rd<=rcoff*rcoff) {
      
                ...
      
                my_epot    += rrd3*(rrd3-1.0);
                my_vir     += rd*r148;
      
                tmpIndex = j;
                #pragma omp atomic
                      f[tmpIndex]    -= xx*r148;
                tmpIndex++;
                #pragma omp atomic

                      f[tmpIndex]  -= zz*r148;
      
              }
      
			}
      
          
          #pragma omp atomic
          	epot    += my_epot;
          #pragma omp atomic
          	vir     -= my_vir;	
      
          tmpIndex =i;
          #pragma omp atomic
          	f[tmpIndex]     += fxi;
          tmpIndex++;
          #pragma omp atomic
          	f[tmpIndex]   += fyi;
          tmpIndex++;
          #pragma omp atomic
          	f[tmpIndex]   += fzi;

Figure \ref{fig:result21} lists the results of a task-oriented run with 8 threads. Load balance is as expected balanced as this task-based approach shares similar advantages as the dynamic schedule from the for construct. However, the total execution time of the threads are significantly larger (approx. 4.5 seconds) then in the result from task 1 using dynamic scheduling, see figure \ref{fig:result11}.
